# responsive-portfolio

In this video, I am going to show you how to build a Personal Portfolio or website that looks great on mobile, tablet and desktop (so in other words, we will make it responsive!). We will be doing this with HTML and CSS, with the tiniest bit of JavaScript. So if you don't know how to use Javascript, don't worry, you can still code along. 

This video is perfect for those looking to learn/improve their CSS and HTML skills. Watch the full video [here](https://youtu.be/-D6oTPA4vXc)

At the end we deploy the site to a .com website so you can share it with your friends.
